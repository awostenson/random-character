# A Character Generator for Fantasy Worldbuilders and TTRPG Players
This project is a comprehensive random generator for people looking to get quick inspiration for worlds and characters in a fantasy setting.

With a dynamic background and colors, the tool changes its appearance to reflect the character and world that it generates. It creates three different aspects of a character, which can be taken separately or as a whole:
- The world surrounding the character, from the climate and economy of their region to the specific qualities of their hometown
- The character's backstory, including their family history
- Aspects relating to the character themself -- personality, history, and appearance
